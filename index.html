<title>UAV Launch Data</title>
<body>As an interest team exploring the relationship between stability and accuracy of drone launched objects, we will provide the following data:
	<p>Based on our own measurement standards and scores, we provide a stable score for the moment the drone drops an object in the following situations.</p>
	<p>This score is related to the drone's flight speed, drone pitch angle, wind speed, wind direction, and flight altitude.</p>
	<p>Given ten sets of corresponding data, except for the final score, in the International System of Units:</p>
	<p>100	pi/4	5	0	100	42000	</p>
	<p>120	pi/6	4	pi/3	300	222100	</p>
	<p>10	pi/3	2	pi/3	10	435	</p>
	<p>50	0	5	0	50	10500	</p>
	<p>20	pi/2	1	0	10	1140	</p>
	<p>15	pi/3	3	pi/6	30	2400	</p>
	<p>150	pi/4	7	pi/3	250	180000	</p>
	<p>25	0	2	pi/2	30	3200	</p>
	<p>5	0	2	0	10	300	</p>
	<p>40	pi/6	3	0	25	4640	</p>
	<p></p>
	<p></p>
	<p></p>
	<p>Based on our measurement standards, we will provide relevant data on the hit accuracy of objects dropped by drones.</p>
	<p>The accuracy score is related to the instantaneous speed of the object, drone pitch angle, wind speed, wind direction, and flight altitude. </p>
	<p>The score is given by measuring the deviation between the actual landing point and the theoretical landing point</p>
	<p>Because it is measured together with the above data, except for the first and last columns, which are different, the rest are the same. The relevant data is as follows:</p>
	<p>120	pi/4	5	0	100	41.95%</p>
	<p>150	pi/6	4	pi/3	300	28.78%</p>
	<p>15	pi/3	2	pi/3	10	77.27%</p>
	<p>65	0	5	0	50	24.89%</p>
	<p>20	pi/2	1	0	10	99.99%</p>
	<p>20	pi/3	3	pi/6	30	82.06%</p>
	<p>175	pi/4	7	pi/3	250	40.47%</p>
	<p>30	0	2	pi/2	30	12.26%</p>
	<p>7.5	0	2	0	10	3.70%</p>
	<p>50	pi/6	3	0	25	24.42%</p>
	<p>Our experimental drones include household drones, slightly larger drones, public drones, and self built drones, and the above data results are self-defined indicators and are not recommended for scientific reference, only for reference!!!</p>
	<p>Our team sincerely hopes to receive your advice and assistance.</p>
	<p>Thanks for your watching.</p>
